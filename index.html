                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am so excited for the opportunity to learn coding through Thinkful along with my other cohort members.  I chose Thinkful because of the emphasis they place on preparing me for starting my career in software development through both the mentorship programs and the live interviews and assessments to imitate a real life interview.</p>
                    <p>My employment background is mainly in customer service so this will be a huge change for me.  Some of my past jobs include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>IC System - Debt Collections</li>
                        <li>Pallet One - Pallet restoration and manufacturing</li>
                        <li>Caribou Coffee</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Outside of coding, my interests include spending time with my wife and daughter, playing video games, listening to music, and smoking meat on my pellet grill.</p>
                    <p>My favorite video games of all time are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The Borderlands franchise</li>
                        <li>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</li>
                        <li>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</li>
                        <li>God of War (2018)</li>
                        <li>Hades</li>
