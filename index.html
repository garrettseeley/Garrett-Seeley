                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am so excited for the opportunity to learn coding through Thinkful along with my other cohort members.  I chose Thinkful because of the emphasis they place on preparing me for starting my career in software development through both the mentorship programs and the live interviews and assessments to imitate a real life interview.</p>
